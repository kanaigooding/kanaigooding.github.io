### Real Lessons
The real, truly important lessons that I took from ICS 314 were not lessons in code, frameworks or any other technical knowledge.  I think the most important lesson of this course was building a comprehensive project from the ground up in a group.  That lesson is stronger and more important than any other lesson I have received at UHM.  In the real world, every project is done with a team, and learning how to do the simple things that go along with project management is equally important to coding itself.
