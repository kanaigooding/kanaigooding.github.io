## That was a lie

Ok.  That was a total absolute 100% lie.  Frameworks do make sense.  They make sense in the fact you can get a lot more done with them in a short time.  My ability to design a website dramatically increased in quality and especially so in how fast I can get it done.  With Semantic UI color changes, border changes are a simple one-word away.  To say things get done fast is an understatement.  For example, this was a website I spent one class period on before Semantic UI.  This is all I could finish in one class period.

And here is what I could get done in nearly half that time using semantic UI!

To say there isn't clear benefits to using UI Frameworks is simply false.  

## However....

However, why do different UIs exist?  Is it necessary to have different competing UIs for web development?  Do I need to learn multiple of these frameworks to become a well-rounded developer?  Why isn't there a more clear and unified framework built into HTML and CSS?  How can we make developments and changes in an industry that has a new framework every 5 years?  How am I, a college student not even in the workforce, learning a framework that could well be irrelevant by the time I even hit the job market?  Frameworks really do not make sense.
