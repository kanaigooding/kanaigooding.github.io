summary: A platform to prepare for technical interviews with challenging problems designed for ICS 314.  
---

The Programing and Algorithms (PANDA) SIG of ACM Manoa presents algorithm mock interview problems to its members.  Currently, it does not have an effective method of collecting and storing submissions.  Without a unified database of problems and solutions work is often repeated by the club officers and students will have to use difficult methods of submission such as Google Docs.  Google Docs is missing key features such as consistent indentation, language-based color (for variables, etc), and the ability to compile and test submissions.  

There should also be a Problems page with a brief overview of the problem.  This should list all published problems.  For inspiration visit https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/.  

Admins of the website should be able to add new problems, they should be able to write the description, assign a difficulty tag, assign the number of points awarded for solving the problem, several test cases, and provide solutions in Java and Python.  Preferably the problem description can be written in markdown, so the admins can create a detailed description of the problem using markdown features.  

Users should be able to answer questions (requiring a sign-in).  By selecting a problem from the problems page, they should be taken to a page to answer the problem where they can record a solution via a textbox.  The text box should include the necessary features to submit Java or Python Code.  The solution should note the language the submission was in.  For inspiration see https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/.  If possible, (if this is reasonable for a student to develop), code can be run in the browser and tested against the solutions submitted by the admin for the before-mentioned test cases.  

Admins should be able to view each problem and see all submitted solutions.  Admins should be able to remove any undesired solution from the database from this page.
